# So what is this about
Okay, so this assignment is to create a "single scrolling webpage" wrapping everything I have done this semester.
Hm, not that hard as I thought but little did I know was that I am much more unprepared that I could have been.

well, looks like im going to make a portfolio!!

The first thing I got to doing was getting some inspiration from some artists on how they present themselves. 
Some of them were:

### [misokabocha](https://quarter-d.com/)

### [SIKAKU_inc](https://4kaku.co.jp/)

### [Khronetic](https://www.kevform.tv/)

Some japanese animators that I look up to and absolutely love their work.

*So,* what did i take away from this browsing spree.
I knew that I wanted my first impression to be statemental, something that had something cool, which was a common theme across all the portfolios i've been looking at + some businesses.

# I feel like you're forgetting something
Oh yeah! I deffinately need to write that artist statement hmm- I got no idea.

>[placehold artist statement idk] 

# Ok baby lets get this started
With that aside, I needed to mess around in Figma and figure out how the hell this thing works.
 
 This is the the result of me panicky putting some design togeather.

I mean it looks decent. But honestly it's just lacking some context.

The stripe texture is created in illustrator and exported as a png, I didn't know how to fully use Figma and used what I thought would be an easier option.

I also had a small chat with my classmate that said that my page looked "nice", ok that wasn't that helpful. But somone else said they liked the "industrial" look of it which I didn't think much of as I was rather going for a more "techy" style as I'm more into that.

###### ~~Oh I look terrible in this picture~~

For accessibility I method I knew was either check the contrast of the elements but here I already knew i only exclusively used dark text on a light background or the opposite with light text. So, instead I would zoom out and make the preview smaller where I sould barely see the text but enough to be able to read it, for parts that were either too small or obstructed by pattern, which I saw when the quote was under the cross patten I knew I needed to get rid of that overlap for clarity.
