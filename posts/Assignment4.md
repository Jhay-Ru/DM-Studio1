# So what is this about
Okay, so this assignment is to create a "single scrolling webpage" wrapping everything I have done this semester.
Hm, not that hard as I thought but little did I know was that I am much more unprepared that I could have been.

well, looks like im going to make a portfolio!!

Some of them were:

Some japanese animators that I look up to and absolutely love their work.
