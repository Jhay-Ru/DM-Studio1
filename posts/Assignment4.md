# So what is this about
Okay, so this assignment is to create a "single scrolling webpage" that wraps up everything I have done this semester.
Hmm, not as hard as I thought but little did I know was that I was much more unprepared than I could have been.

Well, looks like im going to make a portfolio!!

The first thing I got to do was get some inspiration from some artists on how they present themselves. 
Some of them were:

### [SIKAKU_inc](https://4kaku.co.jp/)

### [Khronetic](https://www.kevform.tv/)

I look up to some Japanese animators, and I absolutely love their work.

*So,* what did I take away from this browsing spree?
I knew that I wanted my first impression to be statemental, something that had something cool, which was a common theme across all the portfolios I've been looking at + some businesses.

# I feel like you're forgetting something
Oh yeah! I need to write that artist statement hmm- I have no idea.

> My semester work is a journey through creativity and exploration. I began with a reflective video and I recorded everything from my perspective, where I presented my identity as a fresh graduate with pastimes in the city. It leads to creating a set of icons for an imaginary site and an expansive and reflective 3d digital environment. In this work, I explore my own identity while using this work as a way to express my interests and niches. With that, I aim for people to know what kind of person I am through my niche references and obvious obsessions in a digital environment.  

# Ok baby let's get this started
With that aside, I needed to mess around in Figma and figure out how the hell this thing works.
 
 This is the result of my panicky putting some design together.

I mean it looks decent. But honestly, it's just lacking some context.

The stripe texture is created in Illustrator and exported as a PNG, I didn't know how to fully use Figma and used what I thought would be an easier option.

I also had a small chat with my classmate who said that my page looked "nice", ok that wasn't that helpful. But someone else said they liked the "industrial" look of it which I didn't think much of as I was rather going for a more "techy" style as I'm more into that.

###### ~~Oh I look terrible in this picture~~

For accessibility, a method I knew was either to check the contrast of the elements but here I already knew I only exclusively used dark text on a light background or the opposite with light text. So, instead, I would zoom out and make the preview smaller so that I could barely see the text but enough to be able to read it, for parts that were either too small or obstructed by pattern, which I saw when the quote was under the cross pattern I knew I needed to get rid of that overlap for clarity.
