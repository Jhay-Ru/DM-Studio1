# So what is this about
Ok, the assignment states to create a 3d enviromate that should feature 3-5 encounters that represents "change"

*"uh what the hell does that mean"?*

As wonderful Thomas mentions is to represent a moment in life where you went to one "place" to another. 
> try making each of those encounters memories that you have, that can be used to show "change" 
##### *huh, that's actually a good point- Thanks Thomas"
