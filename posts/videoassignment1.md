## Beginning

Seems a bit litral but it is where iI spend most of the time in the day, my room. Here it shows the whiteboard with a cutout from my previous school's news letter symbolalising the "new point in life" part of my video.

Here, I also showcased myself drawing as that is another thing I am very intrested in.

A typical commute to the city, I tried focusing on the trains here because I am fairly fond of them here's it's a siemens nexus train/////////// set 763 with 751
