# So what is this about
Ok, the assignment states to create a 3d enviromate that should feature 3-5 encounters that represents "change"

*"uh what the hell does that mean"?*

As wonderful Thomas mentions is to represent a moment in life where you went to one "place" to another. 
> try making each of those encounters memories that you have, that can be used to show "change" 
###### *huh, that's actually a good point- Thanks Thomas"

There I decided to make it about "Growing up", how so? I can bring up a memory where i was a *tiny* kid and everything i saw was big, the furniture, the, walls, and the year 6 kids. As i get older, things start changing, I don't remember that garden looking that big, those year prep students look awfully large for their age and me and my other classmates look tiny. And look at me now all big and yet small in the big city ~~where busses break down when I need them the most~~.

# Before the final
Before I started this assignment, I mostly was messing around in unity, getting myself familiar with it. I had *some* prior experience before this back in secondary school.

Here I am making a simple scene making myself familiar with manipulating objects around and applying textures to them.

and here with the terrain, painting in the height and texture. Though I didn't end up using it in my final for a more realistic enviroments.

Here i was going for experimenting with perspective and aligning objects to be viewable from a specific angle.
(It says hi.)
