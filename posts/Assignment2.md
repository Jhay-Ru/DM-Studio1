# So what is this about

Ok, the assignment states to create a suite of 9 icons what follows a theme.

The theme I picked was "System", I wanted these icons to be simple and flat and followed a common motif across all of the icons.

Platform: Mobile app
Context: Audience/user involved research project on birds. The icons are used to assist with navigating the app.
Audience: Bird watchers and anyone intrested in learning about birds

I Went with a silhouette style as most flat icons tend to be that.

Before that was made, I made a variety of concept sketches for each icons

As from those, they gotten peer reviewed, most saying they were pretty "Playful" and thought the birds were "Ducks". ~~They're not ducks.~~

During the illustrator process, I did make some icons that were scrapped.

![Old News Icons](oldiconsnews.png)
the one of the right just didnt feel right with the rest of the set because it had some sizing issues. the left felt off compared to the other blacked out bird icons from the set and wanted to have more unity if the bird is going to be on it.

![old Random icon](oldiconsrandom.png)
This one was scrapped because it felt to bulky and too large, plus I could not think of a way to put the bird motif in there and not make it too small.

## Sounds
I only made sounds for two of the icons, and I simply forgot to export the audio before returning the recorder. *anyways*
the ones i made was for Catalogue and map, the rest are from Pixabay which is a royalty free assets site
They were created by rustling a piece of paper, and the other is a layered clothes flapping.
