# So what is this about

Ok, the assignment states to create a suite of 9 icons what follows a theme.

The theme I picked was "System", I wanted these icons to be simple and flat and followed a common motif across all of the icons.

Platform: Mobile app
Context: Audience/user involved research project on birds. The icons are used to assist with navigating the app.
Audience: Bird watchers and anyone intrested in learning about birds
